# Website project D0018E

E-com website with simple database

## Architecture ##
We use the **three tier architecture** which includes three tiers:
- client
- application
- and database.

This is similar to the classic client-server architecture such that a client with a web browser interacts with our server through the HTTP protocol. The incoming requests and client serving is handled by a web framework. The framework also handles the logic and can in turn communicate with a database using the SQL protocol. 



## Limitations and improvements ##
- Design patterns
- Pagination
- Complement login system using cookies with database.
- Logging can be improved by a lot.
- Error handling
- Security (session handling, hashing passwords)
- See github issues in our repo for more improvements
